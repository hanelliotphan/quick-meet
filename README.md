## Brief Discussion
This project is to create list of action items based on the meeting transcriptions using Python and Llama-3 model. This notebook is used solely for research purpose. The source code of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/hanelliotphan/quick-meet).

## Architecture
This project uses the OpenAI's Whisper-1 model for audio-to-text transcription, and Meta's LLama-3 model for quantization for the process of generating list of action items.

For more information about the model, please read the following documentation
